### Introduction ###

In this exercise, you will be running all of the calculations necessary to calculate the formation energies of the metal organic frameworks we'll be working with for this project.

The formation energy is very simply the reaction energy of the following reaction:

<center>Empty Organic Framework + Bulk Metal $$\mathrm{\rightarrow}$$ Metal Organic Framework</center>

So, you will calculate all three of those energies this week using density functional theory (DFT).

### Required Files ###

Obtain the required files by running:

on Sherlock:

```bash
cd $SCRATCH
cp -r /scratch/users/brohr/TA_CHE444/Exercise_1_Formation_Energies .
```

This should create a folder called `Exercise_1_Formation_Energies/` containing subfolders with all the starter scripts you will need. By default, The output for your calculations will be written into the folder from where you submitted the script. To perform new calculations, you will generally be copying the scripts from these tutorials into new folders, modifying them, and submitting them.

#### Lattice Constant Determination and Bulk Metal Energies ####

Some of you are assigned one metal, and others are assigned two metals.
For each metal, do the following steps:

<br>1) You will need to use some basic UNIX commands for this. You can use <a href="https://brohr.github.io/UNIX/">our notes</a> as a reference or find other resources online if you prefer.
<br>2) Go to the `Exercise_1_Formation_Energies/Bulk/` folder.
<br>3) Make a directory for the lattice optimization calculation for the metal.
<br>4) Look up the <a href="http://periodictable.com/Properties/A/LatticeConstants.html">crystal structure and lattice constant(s)</a> of your material. BCC and FCC structures have only one lattice constant. HCP structures have two.
<br>5) Copy the lattice optimization script associated with your crystal structure into the directory you created.
<br>6) Edit the first two lines of the script - edit the name of the metal to be the name of your metal, and use the lattice constant(s) you looked up as the initial guess (in Angstrom). You can <a href="https://brohr.github.io/UNIX/#text-editors">edit the file using the vim text editor</a>.
<br>7) Submit the lattice optimization script to the supercomputer cluster by running

```bash
sbatch --job-name=$PWD lattice_opt_CRYSTALSTRUCTURE.py
```
Here, `--job-name=$PWD` sets the current working directory as the job name.

If you need to cancel a job, see the instructions <a href="https://brohr.github.io/UNIX/#submitting-jobs">here</a>.

### Clean Metal-Doped Graphene Catalyst (One Metal) ###

We have calculated the energy for:
<br>1) The intact graphene lattice
<br>2) The graphene lattice with the metal atoms in vacancies that are close together
<br>3) The graphene lattice with the metal atoms in vacancies that are far apart
<br>4) The graphene lattice with only one metal atom in the unit cell

The DFT calculations on the clean catalysts are done for you. To find the resulting energies:
<br>1) Type `cd /scratch/users/brohr/TA_CHE444/Exercise_1_Formation_Energies/Graphene/calculations`
<br>2) As usual, type `ls` or `ll` to see what is in the folder
<br>3) Navigate through the folder to find your system. The folder names should be self-explanatory.
<br>4) Type `cat out.energy` to see the energy calculated by DFT

### Analysis ###

When the lattice optimization calculation is finished, the energy of the system is the last number in the first column of `lattice_opt.log`. You can view that energy by navigating to the directory that the calculation was run in and typing `cat lattice_opt.log` The energy per atom of the bulk metal ($$\mathrm{E_{Bulk Metal}}$$) is simply this total energy divided by the number of atoms in the unit cell.

When the optimization calculations are finished, the energy of each system will be stored in a file called `out.energy` in the directory that the calculation was run in. You can view that energy by navigating to the directory that the calculation was run in and typing `cat out.energy` 

The formation energy is given by:

$$\mathrm{E_{metal-doped-graphene} - C*E_{intact-graphene-per-carbon} - N*E_{Bulk Metal}}$$

where N is the number of metal atoms in the metal-doped-graphene unit cell and "C" is the number of carbon atoms in the metal-doped-graphene unit cell. The formation energies may be uphill. This system would be difficult to synthesize, but this is a good way to study similar-looking active sites in real materials without wasting the computational power on modeling the real systems.
